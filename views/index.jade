    p is a bulletin board which uses Bitcoin for a Sybil-attack-resistant message ranking. User which supports a particular message can sign its hash using one of his addresses which holds some amount of bitcoins and submit this signature to Sentiment. Sentiment collects all signatures, computers a total amount of bitcoins which support a particular message and uses that for ranking. The idea is that this ranking corresponds to the sentiment of Bitcoin users weighted by the amount of bitcoins they own.
